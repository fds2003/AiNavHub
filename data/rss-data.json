      "description": "arXiv:2509.23006v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Agentic AI represents a paradigm shift in enhancing the capabilities of generative AI models. While these systems demonstrate immense potential and power, current evaluation techniques primarily focus on assessing their efficacy in identifying appropriate agents, tools, and parameters. However, a critical gap exists in evaluating the alignment between an Agentic AI system's tasks and its overarching goals. This paper introduces the Creative Advers",

      "description": "arXiv:2509.23004v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: A core goal in modern science is to harness recent advances in AI and computer processing to automate and accelerate the scientific method. Symbolic regression can fit interpretable models to data, but these models often sit outside established theory. Recent systems (e.g., AI Descartes, AI Hilbert) enforce derivability from prior axioms. However, sometimes new data and associated hypotheses derived from data are not consistent with existing theor",

      "description": "arXiv:2509.22984v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) vary widely in their capabilities, with larger models often having better performance but higher cost: choosing an LLM model often involves trading off performance and cost. The LLM Cascade is a paradigm that defers difficult queries from weak/cheap to strong/expensive models. This approach is nonadaptive: the deferral decision is trained offline. When confronted with similar or repeated queries, the LLM Cascade may th",

      "description": "arXiv:2509.22888v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Standard LLM evaluation practices compress diverse abilities into single scores, obscuring their inherently multidimensional nature. We present JE-IRT, a geometric item-response framework that embeds both LLMs and questions in a shared space. For question embeddings, the direction encodes semantics and the norm encodes difficulty, while correctness on each question is determined by the geometric interaction between the model and question embedding",

Formal theorem proving systems such as Lean 4 offer automated verification with complete accuracy, motivating recent efforts to build specialized prover LLMs that generate verifiable proofs in formal languages. However, a significant gap remains: current prover LLMs solve substan",
