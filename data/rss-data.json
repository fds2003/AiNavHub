Unlike prior methods that rely on heuristic rules or subjective LLM judgments, Sentinel grounds practical safety requirements in formal temporal logic (TL) semantics that can precisely specify state invariants, temporal dependencies, and timing constraints.

This \"rule-rigidity\" is a significant barrier to building trustworthy autonomous agents.
